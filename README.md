# I READ 4 YOU

I Read 4 You, is a platform that aims to connect tattooers, artists, and designers with visually impaired people for bookings, consultations, and the final delivery of customized work with the help of inclusive coding for users with visual impairments. 

The long-term goal of I Read 4 You is to purposely implement the proper and complete semantic language that facilitates the "README" addons and technologies that are available, like Aria Label , so that visually impaired users have a more enjoyable and successful user experience.

When arriving at the main page, there is an image of a hand drawing an ear, it is the Super image of this project and gives an artistic idea of what the project is about.

- __Club Ethos Section__

  The goal of the Club Ethos section aims to emphasize the reason the project exists. it makes clear the benefits as artists, as well as a client on why you would benefit from using the platform. 
  This should encourage and convince artists as well as users of the benefits of using the platform. as well as inspire them to create and want to acquire art.

 __The Footer__ 

 The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for I Read 4 You. These links are carefully organized and will open to a new tab, this allows the user not to lose the main page and get away from our main page. 
 The footer is very important since it helps the user reach easily other platforms where information is uploaded and share constantly.

- __Gallery__
  The gallery will feature available artwork from featured artists. Each piece of art will be linked and connected to each of the artists' homepages and information.
  Each image will also include an extensive and full image description and links to references and inspirations if available. This way, visually impaired users can navigate and select desired artwork available. 
  It will develop in different sections in the future with categories of style, the format of the piece, the material used, etc... for easier navigation of visually impaired users.

### Features Left to Implement

- In the future, there will be separate forms to fill out depending on whether you are an artist wanting to submit your art, or a user trying to acquire it. 
- There is the wish to create an app where the users can scan some images and get a descriptive description of the piece of art or illustration. 
- As it will also help with the booking and communication between artists and clients, there will also be a chat available and a service for booking appointments.
- The platform will soon have its own logo. 

## Testing 
- Several tests were made on small and big screens. The site was tested in Google Chrome and was tested on iPhone screens as well as iPad Pro. 
Testing was also conducted with Dev tools. The headers, texts, and features adapt easily to different screen sizes when opened on as many devices as I could try around me. 

- After deploying and sharing the link to my project, all the links are proven to work properly, the media links send you to the right web pages.
