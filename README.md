# I READ 4 YOU

I Read 4 You, is a platform that aims to connect tattooers, artists, and designers with visually impaired people for bookings, consultations, and the final delivery of customized work with the help of inclusive coding for users with visual impairments. 

The long-term goal of I Read 4 You is to purposely implement the proper and complete semantic language that facilitates the "README" addons and technologies that are available, like Aria Label , so that visually impaired users have a more enjoyable and successful user experience.

 __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for I Read 4 You. These links are carefully organized and will open to a new tab, this allows the user not to lose the main page and get away from our main page. 
  - The footer is very important since it helps the user reach easily other platforms where information is uploaded and share constantly.

### Features Left to Implement

- -In the future, there will be separate forms to fill out depending on whether you are an artist wanting to submit your art, or a user trying to acquire it. 
- There is the wish to create an app where the users can scan some images and get a descriptive description of the piece of art or illustration. 
- As it will also help with the booking and communication between artists and clients, there will also be a chat available and a service for booking appointments.
- The platform will soon have its own logo. 

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
