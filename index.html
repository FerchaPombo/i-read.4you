            <h2 id="why">Why</h2>
            <p id="paragraph-why"> 
                Because web experiences are inherently visual, the web is fraught with sites, tools, and apps that are practically unusable for people with visual impairments. For example, itâ€™s not uncommon to see websites that use combinations of background and foreground colors that make pages virtually unreadable for colorblind users. Despite all this, people with visual impairments use the web every day to surf, read and write emails, and to do anything else anyone can conceivably do on the internet.
            <br>
            <br>
                I Read 4 You, is a platform that aims to connect tattooers, artists, and designers with visually impaired people for bookings, consultations, and the final delivery of customized work with the help of inclusive coding for users with visual impairments. 
                In this first step, I read You, a newborn project that aims to give information about the current progress on the languages available, their origins, their backgrounds, and the important need for their existence and application in the current coding world, as well as in the creative field. 
              </p>
              <h2 id="how">How</h2>
              <p id="paragraph-how"> 
                When joining I Read 4 You as an artist, you compromise to make your art accessible by creating precise and detailed descriptions of each of your pieces, how it was created, and their purpose. Have an easily made template with basic information to be filled up so it is easier for you to have a useful descriptive text that can be used within the platform with most of the apps that read out loud webpages. The more, the better. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Then, thanks to the implementation of certain criteria when designing and also the usage of the latest technology available we want to make it easier for visually impaired people to acquire art pieces, get tattooed, or request costume art.
