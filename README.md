Project Title

I Read 4 You

Description

I Read 4 You, is a platform that aims to connect tattooers, artists, and designers with visually impaired people for bookings, consultations, and the final delivery of customized work with the help of inclusive coding for users with visual impairments. 
In this first step, I read You, a newborn project that aims to give information about the current progress on the languages available, their origins, their backgrounds, and the important need for their existence and application in the current coding world, as well as in the creative field. 

The long-term goal of I Read 4 You is to purposely implement the proper and complete semantic language that facilitates the "README" addons and technologies that are available, like Aria Label , so that visually impaired users have a more enjoyable and successful user experience.
